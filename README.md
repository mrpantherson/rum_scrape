# rum_scrape
A simple web scraper for the site rum ratings, certainly some room for improvement if anybody wants to contribute (or if I ever get around to it). Two biggest issues currently is that price is hidden behind a pay wall and that many of the company names are unknown.

## Prerequisites
Check req.txt. I'm using requests, beautiful soup, and pandas.
